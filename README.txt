1. Because this app uses the camera feature, it may be beneficial to enable the Emulator's webcam, if you'd like to test taking pictures of
real life objects instead of the Emulator's default living room.  To do this, go to AVD advanced settings.  In the "Camera" section, set
the option of "Front" to be Webcam() and the option of "Back" to be Emulated.
